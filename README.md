## Requirements

Design and build an in-memory key value database that can add, update, delete and retrieve data.
The database must be able to be accessed and manipulated through HTTP and TCP protocols.

## Considerations

- How will the data be presented to the client?
- How can we ensure this database will be scaleable?
- How can we avoid data races?
